OpenMW: A reimplementation of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind

OpenMW is an attempt at recreating the engine for the popular role-playing game
Morrowind by Bethesda Softworks. You need to own and install the original game for OpenMW to work.

Version: 0.11.1
License: GPL (see GPL3.txt for more information)
Website: http://www.openmw.org


THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS


INSTALLATION

Windows:
Just unpack to a location of your choice. Currently there is no installer.

Linux:
Ubuntu (and most others)
Download the .deb file and install it in the usual way.

Arch Linux
There's an OpenMW package available in the AUR Repository:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=21419

OS X:
TODO add description for OS X


BUILD FROM SOURCE

TODO add description here


THE DATA PATH

After the installation OpenMW needs to be told where to find the Morrowind data directory. Create a text file named openmw.cfg (location depends on platform) and enter the following line:

data=path to your data directory

(where you replace "path to your data directory" with the actual location of your data directory)

On Windows a suitable location for the cfg file is alongside the binary. Currently the binary release comes with such a file pre-generated, but you still need to adjust the data setting.

On Linux and Mac the default location will be ~/.config/openmw/openmw.cfg.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
